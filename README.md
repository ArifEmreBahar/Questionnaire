# Questionnaire
A Photon PUN 2â€“powered questionnaire system for Unity, using a synchronized state machine to guide players from answering questions to reviewing and displaying results. It spawns question types via a factory, syncs inputs with UI handlers, compares answers by rules, and generates summaries that can be shown, saved, or replayed across clients.
