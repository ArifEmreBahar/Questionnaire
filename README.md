# Questionnaire
A network-synced questionnaire framework for Unity with Photon PUN 2, driving interactive assessments through a state-machine flow of Inactive → Selection → Summary → Display. It organizes content into QuestionnaireItemData bundles, instantiates per-type questions via a QuestionFactory (MultipleChoice, BinarySelect, FreeDigit, SortOrder), and manages UI through specialized handlers that highlight options, capture inputs, and dispatch QuestionEvents on correct or incorrect answers. A comparer layer enforces answer rules (Match, Unique, Specific, OneSpecific, AnyValid), with a permutation-aware variant for SortOrder, ensuring consistent evaluation across clients. The system tracks left/right selections, aggregates results into QuestionnaireSummary entries, and transitions to summaries that can show the previous response or all past progress, with display modes ranging from free text to “most selected” answer highlights. Session data is stored in BundleSummaries, persisted to disk via a JSON-based saver, and browsed later through an in-game displayer. State objects, UI panels, and phase transitions are fully synchronized over the network with demand-driven RPCs, while custom Odin attribute processors streamline editor setup for questions, bundles, and manager configuration.
